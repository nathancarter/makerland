            <p>This hands-on guide teaches you how to change the world
                around you in MakerLand.  From the first steps, you'll gain
                new powers and see how to put them into action.</p>
            <p>It starts easy, with topics that require no coding, no art,
                and no planning ahead.  More advanced topics appear
                later.</p>
            <p>By the end, you will be able to fully sculpt the Sample
                Universe, or some other universe, or make a universe from
                scratch!</p>

            <h2>Teleporting</h2>
            <p>You can choose a set of locations in the game world that are
                important to you, and then later instantaneously leap to any
                one of them.</p>
            <p><a href='commands.html#teleport'>&#9193; Read about the
                Teleport command on the Commands page.</a></p>

              <div class='col-md-7'>
                <p>The Game Database is
                the list of all things the game knows about, including
                player accounts, square images that make up the map,
                other images that sit on top of the map, sounds, animations,
                behaviors, and more.  The Database command lets you add to
                this big library of information, so that you can put new
                things into the game.</p>
                <p><a href='commands.html#database'>&#9193; Read about the
                Database command on the Commands page.</a>  For now, just
                read the the Introduction and Basic Tables sections.  (We
                will do the more advanced sections later.)</p>
                <p>&#9194; Come back here afterward.</p>

                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                The Database command does not allow you to edit the world
                around you.  The Game Database is just the collection of
                things that <i>could</i> be added to the game world.  After
                you learn how to add things to the database, we'll look at
                the World command, which lets you then place copies of them
                all around the game world.  (That's the section after this
                one.)</div>

            <h2>Changing the World</h2>
            <p>So far you've
            learned how to add new things to the game's database (its
            library of known objects, pictures, and so on) but not how
            to place those things into the game world.  It's time to
            learn that!  The "World" command is what you need...</p>
            <p><a href='commands.html#world'>&#9193; Read about the
            World command on the Commands page.</a></p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here afterward.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Adding More Content</h2>
            <p>As you saw when reading about the World command, there are
            things you can put in the world that we haven't discussed yet,
            such as Landscape Items.  If you've been in the Sample Universe,
            you've seen landscape items in the form of signs, trees, and a
            portal.  Let's take a moment to learn how to put such elements
            into the database, as well as Creatures and Movable Items.</p>
            <p><a href='commands.html#database'>&#9193; Return to the
            Database command on the Commands page and now read about the
            Intermidate Tables.</a></p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here afterward.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Cleaning Up</h2>
            <p>You should now know how to create Movable Items in your
            inventory, and spawn Creatures in your environment.  Especially
            if you start dropping items in your environment, you may be
            making a mess by now!  Here's how to clean it up:</p>

            Reset command on the Commands page.</a></p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Getting interactive</h2>
            <p>All the changes you've made to your environment so far are
            either non-interactive (such as changing the map or the items
            that sit, unmoving, on top of it) or require your presence
            (such as creating new creatures in your environment).  Of
            course, you will want to know how to make interactive places
            that function even when you are not standing there executing
            maker commands!  That's where <i>behaviors</i> come in.</p>
            <p><a href='coding.html'>&#9193; Visit the Coding
            page, but just read the first three sections about
            Behaviors.</a>  (That is, read from "What are behaviors?"
            through "Many opportunities."  These sections do not require
            you to learn to code.)</p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here afterward to try out your most
            interesting projects yet!</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>The expanding universe</h2>
            <p>There are a LOT of things you can now do with the Sample
            Universe, leveraging what you know about behaviors.  This is a
            great place to stop learning new things and just practice what
            you already know.</p>
            <p><a href='ideas.html#basic-behaviors'>&#9193; Visit the Ideas
            page, and read the section on Basic Behaviors.</a>  Pick and
            choose whatever seems most interesting to you, and do it in your
            copy of the Sample Universe.</p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here when you're done building and want to
            learn something new.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Making your own behaviors</h2>
            <p>If you want to make your own behaviors, you will need to
            know or learn JavaScript, which is the programming language used
            throughout MakerLand.  If you do know JavaScript (or want to try
            to learn it while you learn MakerLand coding), then:</p>
            <p><a href='coding.html#writing-behaviors'>&#9193; Read the
            Writing Behaviors section of the Coding page,</a> which includes
            LOTS of reference code to learn from and ideas you can try to
            build as you learn.</p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here when you're done building and want to
            move beyond behaviors, to animations and abilities.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Adding animation</h2>
            <p>If you've been playing in the Sample Universe, you may notice
            that it's lacking a lot in the animation department.  Things are
            pretty rudimentary.  But that's not because the game has no
            animations.  Rather, it is because those animations are fully
            customizable, and the Sample Universe comes with only bare
            bones customization regarding animations.</p>
            <p>You can add animations to the game that happen in response to
            game events such as speaking, combat, or movement, or that
            happen whenever you want them to, based on behaviors you've
            written.</p>
            <p><a href='coding.html#animations'>&#9193; Read the
            Animations section of the Coding page,</a> learn from the
            built-in example animations in the Sample Universe, and try
            some of the animation ideas on the coding page.</p>
            <p>&#9194; Come back here when you want to move to the final
            coding lesson, on abilities.</p>

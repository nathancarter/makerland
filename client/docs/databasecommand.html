                <h1>The Database Command</h1>
                <p class="lead">Managing the pictures, sounds, behaviors,
                    and more that exist in the game</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Database Tables</h2>
            <p>If you click the Database command button, you'll see a list
                of "tables" in the database.  Each contains a different kind
                of information.  Here are explanations of each of them,
                in the order that's easiest to learn (not the order they
                appear in the game).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accounts - player accounts, which includes players'
                    names, passwords, and the commands they can use</li>
                <li>Planes - each wide, flat area in the game is called a
                    "plane," and makers can create and edit new ones</li>
                <li>Cell types - each square on the game map is called a
                    "cell," and this table contains the pictures and other
                    data for all the different types of cells there are</li>
                <li>Landscape items - objects that sit on top of the map
                    cells (like trees, rocks, walls, furniture, and so on)
                    are landscape items, and this table contains the
                    pictures and other data for all the different types
                    of landscape items there are</li>
                <li>Behaviors - names, descriptions, and code for behaviors
                    that can be added to items in the world</li>
                <li>Animations - names, durations, and code for visible
                    animations</li>
                <li>Maker error logs - once you start writing code in the
                    game, any errors in it will be stored here for you to
                    browse and fix</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's look at each of these tables in turn and see what we
                can learn to do with them right now.</p>
            <h2>Accounts Table</h2>
            <p>Only the Admin character can change player accounts, so all
                other makers do not need to bother with this table.</p>
            <h2>Planes Table</h2>
            <p>As a maker, you can create as many new planes in the game as
                you like, and customize each to your heart's content.  For
                example, you might make one plane that is your own home, and
                which no one else can visit.  Then you might make yet
                another plane that you want to eventually be an area where
                players will do a quest to retrieve stolen gold from an evil
                dragon.  You can fill that plane with the map, items, and
                creatures necessary for that adventure, and when it's all
                perfect, create a way for (non-maker) players to get there
                (maybe by boat, or by portal, or through a secret cave).</p>
            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                To create a new plane, follow the instructions below.</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Database command button.</li>
                <li>Click the Planes table button.</li>
                <li>There may be many planes listed, and most of them will
                    just have a "copy" button.  You can always create a new
                    plane by copying an old one, but that's not how we will
                    proceed now.  Scroll to the bottom of the list and click
                    "Add entry."</li>
                <li>A message will tell you that a new plane has been
                    created.  Click OK and scroll to the bottom of the list
                    to find it.</li>
                <li>Unlike the other planes on the list, this one will have
                    not only a copy button, but also "remove" and "edit."
                    You could delete it with "remove" if you don't need it
                    any more, but we want this plane, so don't do that.
                    Instead, click "edit."</li>
                <li>Before editing any of the plane's details, click the
                    "Teleport to this plane" button near the bottom.  Your
                    avatar will immediately appear on an empty surface that
                    looks like graph paper, because it has no cells in it
                    yet.  We'll fix that soon.</li>
                <li>Click the "Change" button next to your new plane's name.
                    Fill in your own name for it, and click "Change name."
                </li>
                <li>Your name should be the only author listed.  No one can
                    edit or remove this plane except you.  If you ever want
                    to share authorship, edit that list and add another
                    maker's name.  Similarly, if someone shares one of their
                    planes with you, then it will have edit/remove/copy
                    buttons associated with it, rather than just the copy
                    button.</li>
                <li>There will be no default cell type for the plane, which
                    is why it looks like graph paper at present.  Click the
                    "Change" button for default cell type, and pick a
                    type.  If you want a grassy area, choose grass.  If you
                    want a desert area, choose sand, and so on.
                    <div class="alert alert-warning"
                         role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                        Below you will see how to extend this list of cell
                        types with new ones, but for now, choose something
                        already in the database.</div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger"
                         role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                        Be sure to choose a cell type that isn't a wall, or
                        water, or something impossible to walk on!  You're
                        about to fill your whole plane with this cell type.
                        If you make it something you can't stand on, the
                        game will immediately teleport you out of the plane,
                        until you fix the mistake and teleport back.</div>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it!  You've created a plane!</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, it's all the same repeated pattern everywhere.
                If you want to make it more interesting, by shaping the
                land around you with many different cell types and other
                decorations, move on to the "Changing the world" section,
                later in this tutorial.</p>

            <h2>Cell Types Table</h2>
            <p>This table contains the pictures and other data related to
                the cells you place on the ground to give a plane its
                background, as well as dictate where players can walk and
                where they cannot.</p>
            <p>If you click the Cell Types table button in the Database
                table list, you will see a list of all cell types in the
                game, with their icons shown.  Just as with planes (and
                most of the database tables) you will see "copy" buttons
                under most of the cell types, but ones for which you are an
                author will also have "remove" and "edit" links.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                To create a new cell type, follow the instructions
                below.</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Database command button, then the Cell Types
                    table button.</li>
                <li>Just as in the Planes table, above, you may see existing
                    cell types for which you are not the author.  Scroll to
                    the bottom and click "Add entry," then find that new
                    entry on the list and click its "edit" button.</li>
                <li>The first thing you'll notice is that your new cell type
                    has no icon, which is essential to using it on the map.
                    You will need to upload an image to use as your cell's
                    icon.  You can create your own image using an image
                    editing program on your computer, or browse the web for
                    an image that looks the way you want it to.  (Just be
                    sure not to take an image unless you have it's author's
                    permission to do so.)  When you have an image file you
                    want to use as the icon, proceed to the next step.</li>
                <li>Click the Change button next to the icon.  Click the
                    Browse button and find on your computer the image file
                    you want to use.
                    <div class="alert alert-danger"
                         role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                        Using very large image files will slow down the
                        game by creating too much network traffic and too
                        much drawing time in the user's browser.  Note the
                        suggested size given to you by the game on the image
                        upload screen, and if your image is too big, first
                        resize it on your computer before uploading it into
                        the game.</div>
                    Click Start upload, then click OK, and you should see
                    your uploaded icon.</li>
                <li>Use the various Change buttons to specify the cell
                    type's name and optionally its border size and color.
                    <div class="alert alert-warning"
                         role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                        Borders are absent by default (size zero) but if you
                        use them, they can help make one particular cell
                        type stand out from its surroundings.  Adjacent
                        cell types that both have borders aren't a good
                        idea.  You will not see the border until you put
                        some cells onto the game map, as taught below.</div>
                </li>
                <li>If you want the cell type to be walkable, leave the
                    "Who can walk on this?" field set to "all."  If you want
                    the cell type to be non-walkable (like a wall, or an
                    ocean) then Change that field and set it to "none."</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Landscape Items Table</h2>
            <p>This table contains the pictures and other data related to
                the items you place on top of the map to give an area its
                foreground.  Such objects have no impact on where players
                can walk, but they may have behaviors attached to them that
                take effect when players are nearby.</p>
            <p>For example, all the trees, rocks, and potted plants you see
                around the game world are landscape items.  If you've ever
                stepped on a portal to be transported to a new area, the
                portal was a landscape item with a teleportation behavior
                attached to it.  And every sign in the game that you can
                read is a landscape item with a behavior attached to show
                text when you stand on it.</p>
            <p>If you click the Landscape Items table button in the Database
                table list, you will see a list of all landscape items in
                the game, with their icons shown.  As before, you will see
                "copy" buttons under most of the entries, but ones for which
                you are an author will also have "remove" and "edit"
                links.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                To create a new landscape item, follow the instructions
                below.</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Database command button, then the Landscape
                    Items table button.</li>
                <li>Proceed exactly as in the previous two sections to
                    create a new entry and begin editing it.  (Scroll down,
                    click "Add entry", click OK, find the entry, click
                    "edit.")</li>
                <li>Choose its size (in cells).  Most landscape items are
                    the same size as a cell (size 1).  All landscape items
                    are square.</li>
                <li>Change its icon in exactly the same way that you did for
                    a cell type.
                    <div class="alert alert-warning"
                         role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                        As with cell types, please use only small files.
                        However, landscape items can have different sizes,
                        so small ones should have small files, and larger
                        ones larger files.  The game itself will suggest
                        specific sizes when you choose to upload an
                        icon.</div>
                    </li>
                <li>Give the landscape item a name.</li>
                <li>Last, you can choose whether the item is visible to
                    players.  If you choose "no," then it will be visible
                    only to makers.  This is useful for making areas where,
                    if a player steps there, some specific behavior is
                    triggered, but you do not want any visible evidence of
                    this fact.  (E.g., some areas do something when you
                    enter them, such as play a sound or bring a greeter;
                    other places you may wish to position a trap.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You have created a new landscape item, but not yet placed any
                copies of it in the game world.  See the section below on
                the "World" command to learn how!</p>

            <h2>Behaviors Table</h2>
            <p>Because creating a new behavior requires coding, this is a
                more advanced topic.  We won't start your life as a maker
                learning this.  Later on, you can visit
                <a href='behaviorcoding.html'>the page that teaches all
                about coding behaviors</a> and learn as much as you like.
            </p>

            <h2>Animations Table</h2>
            <p>Just as with behaviors, creating a new animation requires
                coding, so it, too, is a more advanced topic.  Later, visit
                <a href='animationcoding.html'>the page that teaches all
                about coding animations</a> to learn more.</p>

            <h2>Maker Error Logs Table</h2>

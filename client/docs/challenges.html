                        <li>A friendly creature has lost an item and asks
                            players to find it for him/her.  Finding it and
                            bringing it back will cause the friendly
                            creature to trade the lost item for a reward
                            that has some value to the players.</li>
                        <li>Residents of a peaceful town are being
                            threatened by nearby aggressive monsters, and
                            ask you to defeat them and bring back the body
                            of the leader as evidence that they can rest
                            safely at night once again.</li>
                        <li>A child or pet has wandered off into dangerous
                            territory.  You must find the lost creature,
                            defend it from any aggressive monsters nearby,

                    <p>Your game world needs to be large for it to be
                    enjoyable for players to enter.  They need to feel that
                    there is enough for them to explore, so that they can

                    (No one wants to kill the same 4 bandits over and over.)
                    Create many different areas of your world, each with its
                    own unique style, so that players can walk a long way

                    simply create copies of the same goblin and increasing
                    its stats.</p>
                    <p>Create many different monsters, and populate the
                    many areas of your game with them.  Big, strong things
                    (like dragons) should have correspondingly great stats,

                    be trivial to defeat.  Everything else should sit
                    sensibly on the spectrum in between.  The more creatures
                    you create, the more interesting your game world will be
                    to explore, and the longer players can play before they
                    feel that they've "seen it all."</p>

                    example, if you created some abilities that soldiers
                    would have, you can create an army base where there are
                    soldiers that will train you in the abilities.  Or if
                    you created engineering abilities, there may be a school
                    that will train players in those abilities.</p>
                    <p>It's up to you whether you want the players to have
                    to somehow earn the abilities, through quests, puzzles,
                    combat, exploration, experience points, or trade.  Your
                    areas should include a way for players to get new
                    commands for each ability, and ways to train the
                    corresponding stats for their new abilities.</p>

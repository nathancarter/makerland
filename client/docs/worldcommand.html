                This command functions only in planes for which you are the
                author.  If you're in a common area, it's probably authored
                by the admin character, and you can't edit it.  If you're in
                someone else's plane, they're probably the only author, and
                you can't edit it.  To learn more about authorship for a
                plane, visit <a href='databasecommand.html'>the tutorial on
                the Database command.</a>  For now, the easiest way to use
                this command is to make your own plane, as described in that
                same tutorial, and then use this command in that
                plane.</div>

            <h3>Changing the cells of the map</h3>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">The base layer of
                the map, underneath any trees, rocks, plants, signs,
                pillars, and so on, is a grid of squares, called
                cells.</div>
            <p>The first thing you'll want to edit in a brand new plane
                you've created is that grid of cells.  Here's how.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As described above, be sure you're in a plane that you
                    have permission to edit.</li>
                <li>Click the World command button.</li>
                <li>Click "Change cells in map."</li>
                <li>Click the "Change" button to choose which kind of cells
                    you want to be placing on the map.  Scroll down the
                    list until you find the one you want to use, then click
                    its "Choose" button.
                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    If you don't see the type of cells you want, return to
                    <a href='databasecommand.html'>the page on the database
                    command</a> and follow its directions to add new cell
                    types to the game!</div>
                    </li>
                <li>Click "Place individual cells".</li>
                <li>When you aim the mouse over the map itself, you should
                    now see a crosshair cursor (like a plus), indicating
                    that you're able to edit the map.  Anywhere you click,
                    you will place a copy of your chosen cell.</li>
                <li>When you're done placing that type of cell, click
                    "Done."</li>
                <li>You can then pick another type of cell, or click "Done"
                    if you're finished editing the map cells.</li>

            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                You probably noticed two other buttons in the "Editing map
                cells" screen.  Each is there to make it easier to edit
                large areas of cells all at once.  They function as
                follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill rectangles of cells - after choosing this
                        option, click the top left cell of the area you
                        want to fill, then the bottom right.  The entire
                        rectangular area between your two click points will
                        be filled with the same type of cell.</li>
                    <li>Rectangular border of cells - same as the previous,
                        but does not fill the interior of the rectangular
                        region, only its outer border (one cell thick)</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

            <h3>Decorating with items</h3>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">The upper layer of
                the game map consists of objects that sit on top of the
                map cells.  These objects need not be one-cell-by-one-cell
                in size, and they need not be images that fill a
                square.  They're called "landscape items."
                Examples include plants, rocks, furniture, signs,
                and more.</div>
            <p>Here's how to add landscape items to your plane.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As described above, be sure you're in a plane that you
                    have permission to edit.</li>
                <li>Click the World command button.</li>
                <li>Click "Put landscape items on map."</li>
                <li>As you did when placing cells on the map, begin by
                    choosing a landscape item to place on the map.
                    Click "Change," then find one you want to use, then
                    click "Choose."
                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    If you don't see the item you want, return to
                    <a href='databasecommand.html'>the page on the database
                    command</a> and follow its directions to add new
                    landscape items to the game!</div>
                    </li>
                <li>Click "Place landscape items".</li>
                <li>When you aim the mouse over the map itself, you should
                    now see a crosshair cursor (like a plus), indicating
                    that you're able to edit the map.  Anywhere you click,
                    you will place a copy of your chosen landscape item.
                    The item will be centered on your click point.</li>
                <li>When you're done placing that type of item, click
                    "Done."</li>
                <li>You can then pick another type of landscape item, or
                    click "Done" if you're finished adding landscape
                    items to the map.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                Enjoy some time decorating your part of the game
                world!</div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                You can also edit landscape items once you've placed them.
                The most common use of this is if you placed something in
                the wrong location.  Choose "Edit landscape items on map,"
                then click on an item on the map.  Assuming you clicked on
                just one item, you will then have the option to delete it
                or <a href='behaviorcoding.html'>edit its behaviors</a>
                (an advanced topic).
                If you clicked a spot where more than one item is stacked
                on top of one another, then the game will prompt you with a
                list, from which you can choose the item you meant.

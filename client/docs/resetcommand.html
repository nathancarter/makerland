                <h1>The Reset Command</h1>
                <p class="lead">Refreshing code in objects you can see</p>
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                The Reset command only makes sense after you've learned how
                to code a behavior or an animation.  If you haven't learned
                those things yet, then you don't need the Reset command.
                </div>

            <p>The game map is split up into rectangular blocks of cells.
                As players walk onto new areas of the map, the blocks of
                cells for those new areas are loaded from disk so that
                they are ready to be shown to the player.  Similarly, the
                blocks that the player can no longer see are dropped from
                the game's memory, since no player needs them.</p>
            <p>Each block contains not only cells (the square images that
                make the map look how it does), but also the landscape
                items that sit on top of the cells (e.g., trees, rocks,
                pillars, signs, etc.).  When a block of cells is loaded from
                disk into memory, all its landscape items are also loaded,
                and the behavior code for each is run.</p>
            <p>If you've just edited an item in your environment and need it
                to get reloaded (for example, for
                <a href="behaviorcoding.html">an attached behavior</a> to
                get installed or updated), you can force the game to reload
                all the blocks you can see from scratch.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                Although it's possible to accomplish this by walking
                very far away from your current location, then walking back,
                that's a waste of time, and it only works if no one else is
                around.</div>

            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                To reset the area you can see, click the Reset command
                button.  You will not necessarily see anything happen on
                the game map, but if you edited anything about landscape
                items (such as their behaviors) your changes have now been
                applied.</div>

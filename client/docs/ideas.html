                      Each command should be granted after
                      the player has passed a sign explaining it.
                      (Use the "Gives a player a command" behavior.

                      abilities Help, Database, World, Teleport, and Reset.
                      Be brief, and refer the readers to these very help

                    <p>Rather than having your entire universe connected by
                    walking paths, you'll want to be able to go from place
                    to place by entering a cave, or going down stairs, or
                    walking into a building, or stepping on a magic portal.
                    Create some devices that teleport you (just like the
                    portals in Ideas 1-3, above) in ways realistic to your
                    game world.  Here are some possibilities; each is a
                    landscape item that functions as a portal to another
                    plane, that implements the destination area:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A cave in the side of a mountain that sends you
                            into an underground area.  (Realistically, this
                            should have an obvious cave exit right near
                            where you appear, that takes you right back
                            out.)</li>
                        <li>A mushroom circle that transports you to the
                            realm of the fairies.  (Getting back out might
                            even be a puzzle or quest.)</li>
                        <li>Buildings that, when you step on them take you
                            inside.  (Again, an obvious exit is sensible.)
                            </li>
                        <li>Inside a building, you might have staircases
                            that go up or down, and when you step on them
                            instantly transport you to the next floor above
                            or below.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Not all of these need new planes.  For instance, a
                        multi-story building might be implemented all on one
                        plane, with the floors far apart so you can't see
                        one from the next.  Players will never know.</p>

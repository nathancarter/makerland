                These projects are intended for use in the Sample
                Universe, and require only the behaviors defined in that
                universe initially.  You can do more sophisticated projects
                if you add more behaviors (and you can't even do these
                projects at first if you started with an empty
                universe!).</div>

                    at the point [0,0,0], and have access to only one
                    command, Quit.  (<a href='reference.html#locations'>What
                    does [0,0,0] mean?</a>)  Let's create a
                    tutorial area that gives the player all the basic
                    commands and explains each.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Teleport to "the origin," [0,0,0].  In the Sample

                      spawned.</li>
                      <li>Rework that plane to be a much longer
                      hallway with more signs, plus some landscape
                      items that grant the player new commands as they walk.
                      Each command should be granted after
                      the player has passed a sign explaining it.
                      (Use the "Gives a player a command" behavior.
                      Invisible square landscape items work great for this
                      -- only makers can see them.)</li>
                      <li>The basic commands you should give are Settings,
                      Inspect, Inventory, Players, Talk, Attack, Stats.</li>
                      <li>End with a portal that sends the
                      player to the island.</li>
                      <li>Create a new character and test your

                    <ul>
                      <li>Create new cell types and use them to create a
                      nicer environment, so that the hallway is not
                      just gray stone, dark stone walls, and blackness.</li>
                      <li>Create new landscape items and use them to
                      decorate the hallway, so that it is not composed
                      exclusively of square tiles, but has some
                      decoration.</li>
                      <li>Upload a "new command access" sound to the Sounds
                      table, so that players hear a pleasant sound that
                      cues them to the receiving of each new command.</li>
                      <li>End the tutorial area with a portal that sends the

                    universe to a friend, and you want to promote them to be
                    a maker.  Create a tutorial area to which
                    you could take them that will grant them all the maker
                    commands, explaining each as it appears, just like the
                    New Player Tutorial in Idea 1.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Create a new plane to house the Maker
                      Tutorial.</li>
                      <li>Create a pathway with signs and command-granting
                      landscape items, just as in Idea 1,
                      but instead of basic abilities, grant the Maker
                      abilities Help, Database, World, Teleport, and Reset.
                      Be brief, and refer the readers to these very help
                      pages!</li>
                      <li>At the end, don't include a
                      portal.  Have a sign tell them to use
                      the teleport command!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To grant a player the privilege of
                    being a maker, you as the admin visit that tutorial
                    plane (open it in the database, click its teleport
                    button), and bring the prospective maker
                    to you (view the players list, click their teleport
                    button).  Then let them walk the road!</p>

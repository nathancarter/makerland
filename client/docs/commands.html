            <p>When you're standing at a location to which you'll want to
                be able to teleport later, you should take a moment to add
                it to your list of memorized locations.  Here's how:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Teleport command button.</li>
                <li>Come up with a name for your current location.  This
                    name needs to be meaningful only to you; no one else
                    will see it.  Examples, "Black cave" or "by the ocean"
                    or "hiding spot."</li>
                <li>Type that name into the box that says "type name here."
                </li>
                <li>Click the Add button.</li>
                <li>You should now see the place you just memorized listed
                    among your memorized teleportation destinations, at the
                    top of that same screen.</li>

                    You can't teleport somewhere unless you've already
                    memorized that location.  So think ahead and memorize an
                    important place before you leave it!</div>

                    If you memorize dozens of teleportation destinations,

                    when you're looking for it.  So choose wisely what you
                    add to your list.</div>

                    and memorize it in that way.  Then walk somewhere else,
                    and use the instructions below to teleport back.</div>

            <h3>Teleporting to a destination</h3>
            <p>When you want to teleport somewhere, you use the same
                command.  It's very simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Teleport command button.</li>
                <li>Locate on your list of memorized teleportation
                    destinations the place you want to go.</li>
                <li>Click the button next to it that says "Go here."</li>
                <li>Your avatar will immediately be transported to that
                    loaction.</li>

                <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                    Walk a little distance from one of your memorized
                    teleportation destinations, then use the steps above to
                    teleport back.</div>

              <h3>Database</h3>
              <p>Where to store images, sounds, and more</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>If you click the Database command button, you'll see a list
                of "tables" in the database.  Each contains a different kind
                of information.  Here are explanations of each of them,
                in the order that's easiest to learn (not the order they
                appear in the game).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abilities - names, descriptions, and code for abilities
                    players can learn as they gain experience</li>
                <li>Accounts - player accounts, which includes players'
                    names, passwords, and the commands they can use</li>
                <li>Animations - names, durations, and code for visible
                    animations</li>
                <li>Behaviors - names, descriptions, and code for behaviors
                    that can be added to items in the world</li>
                <li>Cell types - each square on the game map is called a
                    "cell," and this table contains the pictures and other
                    data for all the different types of cells there are</li>
                <li>Creatures - names, images, stats, and behavior for the
                    various people and animals encountered in the game</li>
                <li>Landscape items - objects that sit on top of the map
                    cells (like trees, rocks, walls, furniture, and so on)
                    are landscape items, and this table contains the
                    pictures and other data for all the different types
                    of landscape items there are</li>
                <li>Maker error logs - once you start writing code in the
                    game, any errors in it will be stored here for you to
                    browse and fix</li>
                <li>Movable items - objects that can be picked up and
                    carried around, including food, equipment, and more</li>
                <li>Planes - each wide, flat area in the game is called a
                    "plane," and makers can create and edit new ones</li>
                <li>Sounds - sound effects that play when various events
                    occur in the game</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic tables</h3>

            <p>A few of the tables in the database are quite
                straightforward, and you can get begin editing them with
                just the short introduction given in this section.</p>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">Accounts Table</div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Only the Admin character can change player accounts, so
                all other makers do not need to bother with this table.</p>
                <p>If you are reading this as the Admin character, you can
                use this table in the database to reset passwords, or to
                create accounts in a universe in which you have disabled
                account creation by others.</p>
                <p>No instructions are included here about how to use this
                table, because once you have seen the database interface in
                the instructions for other tables (below), it is easy to
                figure out how to use this table.  Also, it is infrequently
                needed.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">Planes Table</div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>As a maker, you can create as many new planes in the game
                as you like, and customize each to your heart's content.
                For example, you might make one plane that is your own home,
                and which no one else can visit.  Then you might make yet
                another plane that you want to eventually be an area where
                players will do a quest to retrieve stolen gold from an evil
                dragon.  You can fill that plane with the map, items, and
                creatures necessary for that adventure, and when it's all
                perfect, create a way for (non-maker) players to get there
                (maybe by boat, or by portal, or through a secret cave).</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-md-1'>
              </div>
              <div class='col-md-11'>
                <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                    To create a new plane, follow the instructions below.
                    </div>
                <ol>
                <li>Click the Database command button.</li>
                <li>Click the Planes table button.</li>
                <li>There may be many planes listed, and most of them will
                    just have a "copy" button.  You can always create a new
                    plane by copying an old one, but that's not how we will
                    proceed now.  Scroll to the bottom of the list and click
                    "Add entry."</li>
                <li>A message will tell you that a new plane has been
                    created.  Click OK and scroll to the bottom of the list
                    to find it.</li>
                <li>Unlike the other planes on the list, this one will have
                    not only a copy button, but also "remove" and "edit."
                    You could delete it with "remove" if you don't need it
                    any more, but we want this plane, so don't do that.
                    Instead, click "edit."</li>
                <li>Before editing any of the plane's details, click the
                    "Teleport to this plane" button near the bottom.  Your
                    avatar will immediately appear on an empty surface that
                    looks like graph paper, because it has no cells in it
                    yet.  We'll fix that soon.</li>
                <li>Click the "Change" button next to your new plane's name.
                    Fill in your own name for it, and click "Change name."
                </li>
                <li>Your name should be the only author listed.  No one can
                    edit or remove this plane except you.  If you ever want
                    to share authorship, edit that list and add another
                    maker's name.  Similarly, if someone shares one of their
                    planes with you, then it will have edit/remove/copy
                    buttons associated with it, rather than just the copy
                    button.</li>
                <li>There will be no default cell type for the plane, which
                    is why it looks like graph paper at present.  Click the
                    "Change" button for default cell type, and pick a
                    type.  If you want a grassy area, choose grass.  If you
                    want a desert area, choose sand, and so on.
                </ol>
                <div class="alert alert-warning"
                     role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    Below you will see how to extend this list of cell
                    types with new ones, but for now, choose something
                    already in the database.</div>
                <div class="alert alert-danger"
                     role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                    Be sure to choose a cell type that isn't a wall, or
                    water, or something impossible to walk on!  You're
                    about to fill your whole plane with this cell type.
                    If you make it something you can't stand on, the
                    game will immediately teleport you out of the plane,
                    until you fix the mistake and teleport back.</div>
                <p>That's it!  You've created a plane!</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it's all the same repeated pattern
                everywhere.  If you want to make it more interesting, by
                shaping the land around you with many different cell types
                and other decorations, move on to the "Changing the world"
                section, later in this tutorial.</p>

                <p>If you click the Cell Types table button in the Database

                game, with their icons shown.  Just as with planes (and
                most of the database tables) you will see "copy" buttons
                under most of the cell types, but ones for which you are an

                <li>The first thing you'll notice is that your new cell type
                    has no icon, which is essential to using it on the map.
                    You will need to upload an image to use as your cell's

                <p>For instance, there is a "login" sound that's played

              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>This table contains the pictures and other data related
                to the items you place on top of the map to give an area its
                foreground.  Such objects have no impact on where players
                can walk, but they may have behaviors attached to them that
                take effect when players are nearby.</p>
                <p>For example, all the trees, rocks, and potted plants you
                see around the game world are landscape items.  If you've
                ever stepped on a portal to be transported to a new area,
                the portal was a landscape item with a teleportation
                behavior attached to it.  And every sign in the game that
                you can read is a landscape item with a behavior attached to
                show text when you stand on it.</p>
                <p>If you click the Landscape Items table button in the
                Database table list, you will see a list of all landscape
                items in the game, with their icons shown.  As before, you
                will see "copy" buttons under most of the entries, but ones
                for which you are an author will also have "remove" and
                "edit" links.</p>

                <li>Choose its size (in cells).  Most landscape items are
                    the same size as a cell (size 1).  All landscape items
                    are square.</li>
                <li>Change its icon in exactly the same way that you did for
                    a cell type.

                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    As with cell types, please use only small files.
                    However, landscape items can have different sizes,
                    so small ones should have small files, and larger
                    ones larger files.  The game itself will suggest

                <li>Last, you can choose whether the item is visible to
                    players.  If you choose "no," then it will be visible
                    only to makers.  This is useful for making areas where,
                    if a player steps there, some specific behavior is
                    triggered, but you do not want any visible evidence of
                    this fact.  (E.g., some areas do something when you
                    enter them, such as play a sound or bring a greeter;
                    other places you may wish to position a trap.)</li>

                    who have just started playing the game and have not yet
                    earned any kind of bonuses or increases.  Change them
                    as you see fit.  To know what impact "dodging ability"
                    or "attack accuracy" has at various values, create such
                    creatures and experiment with them in combat!</li>
                <li>"Experience" is the amount of experience earned for
                    killing the creature, earned by the player who deals the
                    final blow.  When you click Change, the game performs a
                    very rudimentary computation to suggest a reasonable
                    value based on the creature's other statistics.  Feel
                    free to use it, or adjust it.</li>

                can't edit it.  If you're in someone else's plane, they're

                <a href='commands.html#database'>the Database command.</a>
                For now, the easiest way to use this command is to make your
                own plane (as described at that same location) and then use
                the World command in that plane.</div>

            <h3>Changing the cells of the map</h3>
            <p>The base layer of
                the map, underneath any trees, rocks, plants, signs,
                pillars, and so on, is a grid of squares, called
                cells.</p>
            <p>The first thing you'll want to edit in a brand new plane
                you've created is that grid of cells.  Here's how.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As described above, be sure you're in a plane that you
                    have permission to edit.</li>
                <li>Click the World command button.</li>
                <li>Click "Change cells in map."</li>
                <li>Click the "Change" button to choose which kind of cells
                    you want to be placing on the map.  Scroll down the
                    list until you find the one you want to use, then click
                    its "Choose" button.</li>
                <li>Click "Place individual cells".</li>
                <li>When you aim the mouse over the map itself, you should
                    now see a crosshair cursor (like a plus), indicating
                    that you're able to edit the map.  Anywhere you click,
                    you will place a copy of your chosen cell.</li>
                <li>When you're done placing that type of cell, click
                    "Done."</li>
                <li>You can then pick another type of cell, or click "Done"
                    if you're finished editing the map cells.</li>

                    You probably noticed two other buttons in the "Editing

                    edit large areas of cells all at once.  They function as
                    follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fill rectangles of cells - after choosing this
                            option, click the top left cell of the area you
                            want to fill, then the bottom right.  The entire
                            rectangular area between your two click points
                            will be filled with the same type of cell.</li>
                        <li>Rectangular border of cells - same as the
                            previous, but does not fill the interior of the
                            rectangular region, only its outer border (one
                            cell thick)</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Decorating with items</h3>
            <p>The upper layer of
                the game map consists of objects that sit on top of the
                map cells.  These objects need not be one-cell-by-one-cell
                in size, and they need not be images that fill a
                square.  They're called "landscape items."
                Examples include plants, rocks, furniture, signs,
                and more.</p>
            <p>Here's how to add landscape items to your plane.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As described above, be sure you're in a plane that you
                    have permission to edit.</li>
                <li>Click the World command button.</li>
                <li>Click "Put landscape items on map."</li>
                <li>As you did when placing cells on the map, begin by
                    choosing a landscape item to place on the map.
                    Click "Change," then find one you want to use, then
                    click "Choose."
                <li>Click "Place landscape items".</li>
                <li>When you aim the mouse over the map itself, you should
                    now see a crosshair cursor (like a plus), indicating
                    that you're able to edit the map.  Anywhere you click,
                    you will place a copy of your chosen landscape item.
                    The item will be centered on your click point.</li>
                <li>When you're done placing that type of item, click
                    "Done."</li>
                <li>You can then pick another type of landscape item, or
                    click "Done" if you're finished adding landscape
                    items to the map.</li>

                    You can also edit landscape items once you've placed
                    them.  The most common use of this is if you placed
                    something in the wrong location.  Choose "Edit landscape
                    items on map," then click on an item on the map.
                    Assuming you clicked on just one item, you will then
                    have the option to delete it or

                    will prompt you with a list, from which you can choose
                    the item you meant.</div>

              <h3>Reset</h3>
              <p>Cleaning up your surroundings</p>
            </div>

            <p>The game map is split up into rectangular blocks of cells.
                As players walk onto new areas of the map, the blocks of
                cells for those new areas are loaded from disk so that
                they are ready to be shown to the player.  Similarly, the
                blocks that the player can no longer see are dropped from
                the game's memory, since no player needs them.</p>
            <p>Each block contains not only cells (the square images that
                make the map look how it does), but also the landscape
                items that sit on top of the cells (e.g., trees, rocks,
                pillars, signs, etc.).  When a block of cells is loaded from
                disk into memory, all its landscape items are also loaded,
                and the behavior code for each is run.</p>
            <p>If you've filled your environment with objects you no longer
                want, such as items you created into your inventory and then
                dropped, or creatures you manually spawned near you, you
                may wish to clean it up.  Issue the reset command to destroy
                all such temporary items.</p>

            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-md-4'>
                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                The Reset command only makes sense after you've learned how
                to code a behavior or an animation.  If you haven't learned
                those things yet, then you don't need the Reset command.

            <p>When you're standing at a location to which you'll want to
                be able to teleport later, you should take a moment to add
                it to your list of memorized locations.  Here's how:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Teleport command button.</li>
                <li>Come up with a name for your current location.  This
                    name needs to be meaningful only to you; no one else
                    will see it.  Examples, "Black cave" or "by the ocean"
                    or "hiding spot."</li>
                <li>Type that name into the box that says "type name here."
                </li>
                <li>Click the Add button.</li>
                <li>You should now see the place you just memorized listed
                    among your memorized teleportation destinations, at the
                    top of that same screen.</li>

                    You can't teleport somewhere unless you've already
                    memorized that location.  So think ahead and memorize an
                    important place before you leave it!</div>

                    If you memorize dozens of teleportation destinations,
                    your list will get long and it will be hard to find one
                    when you're looking for it.  So choose wisely what you
                    add to your list.</div>

                    and memorize it in that way.  Then walk somewhere else,
                    and use the instructions below to teleport back.</div>

            <h3>Teleporting to a destination</h3>
            <p>When you want to teleport somewhere, you use the same
                command.  It's very simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Teleport command button.</li>
                <li>Locate on your list of memorized teleportation
                    destinations the place you want to go.</li>
                <li>Click the button next to it that says "Go here."</li>
                <li>Your avatar will immediately be transported to that
                    loaction.</li>

                <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                    Walk a little distance from one of your memorized
                    teleportation destinations, then use the steps above to
                    teleport back.</div>

              <h3>Database</h3>
              <p>Where to store images, sounds, and more</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>If you click the Database command button, you'll see a list
                of "tables" in the database.  Each contains a different kind
                of information.  Here are explanations of each of them,
                in the order that's easiest to learn (not the order they
                appear in the game).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abilities - names, descriptions, and code for abilities
                    players can learn as they gain experience</li>
                <li>Accounts - player accounts, which includes players'
                    names, passwords, and the commands they can use</li>
                <li>Animations - names, durations, and code for visible
                    animations</li>
                <li>Behaviors - names, descriptions, and code for behaviors
                    that can be added to items in the world</li>
                <li>Cell types - each square on the game map is called a
                    "cell," and this table contains the pictures and other
                    data for all the different types of cells there are</li>
                <li>Creatures - names, images, stats, and behavior for the
                    various people and animals encountered in the game</li>
                <li>Landscape items - objects that sit on top of the map
                    cells (like trees, rocks, walls, furniture, and so on)
                    are landscape items, and this table contains the
                    pictures and other data for all the different types
                    of landscape items there are</li>
                <li>Maker error logs - once you start writing code in the
                    game, any errors in it will be stored here for you to
                    browse and fix</li>
                <li>Movable items - objects that can be picked up and
                    carried around, including food, equipment, and more</li>
                <li>Planes - each wide, flat area in the game is called a
                    "plane," and makers can create and edit new ones</li>
                <li>Sounds - sound effects that play when various events
                    occur in the game</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Basic tables</h3>
            <p>A few of the tables in the database are quite
                straightforward, and you can get begin editing them with
                just the short introduction given in this section.</p>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">Accounts Table</div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Only the Admin character can change player accounts, so
                all other makers do not need to bother with this table.</p>
                <p>If you are reading this as the Admin character, you can
                use this table in the database to reset passwords, or to
                create accounts in a universe in which you have disabled
                account creation by others.</p>
                <p>No instructions are included here about how to use this
                table, because once you have seen the database interface in
                the instructions for other tables (below), it is easy to
                figure out how to use this table.  Also, it is infrequently
                needed.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">Planes Table</div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>As a maker, you can create as many new planes in the game
                as you like, and customize each to your heart's content.
                For example, you might make one plane that is your own home,
                and which no one else can visit.  Then you might make yet
                another plane that you want to eventually be an area where
                players will do a quest to retrieve stolen gold from an evil
                dragon.  You can fill that plane with the map, items, and
                creatures necessary for that adventure, and when it's all
                perfect, create a way for (non-maker) players to get there
                (maybe by boat, or by portal, or through a secret cave).</p>

              <div class='col-md-11'>
                <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>Try it!</b>
                    To create a new plane, follow the instructions below.
                    </div>
                <ol>
                <li>Click the Database command button.</li>
                <li>Click the Planes table button.</li>
                <li>There may be many planes listed, and most of them will
                    just have a "copy" button.  You can always create a new
                    plane by copying an old one, but that's not how we will
                    proceed now.  Scroll to the bottom of the list and click
                    "Add entry."</li>
                <li>A message will tell you that a new plane has been
                    created.  Click OK and scroll to the bottom of the list
                    to find it.</li>
                <li>Unlike the other planes on the list, this one will have
                    not only a copy button, but also "remove" and "edit."
                    You could delete it with "remove" if you don't need it
                    any more, but we want this plane, so don't do that.
                    Instead, click "edit."</li>
                <li>Before editing any of the plane's details, click the
                    "Teleport to this plane" button near the bottom.  Your
                    avatar will immediately appear on an empty surface that
                    looks like graph paper, because it has no cells in it
                    yet.  We'll fix that soon.</li>
                <li>Click the "Change" button next to your new plane's name.
                    Fill in your own name for it, and click "Change name."
                </li>
                <li>Your name should be the only author listed.  No one can
                    edit or remove this plane except you.  If you ever want
                    to share authorship, edit that list and add another
                    maker's name.  Similarly, if someone shares one of their
                    planes with you, then it will have edit/remove/copy
                    buttons associated with it, rather than just the copy
                    button.</li>
                <li>There will be no default cell type for the plane, which
                    is why it looks like graph paper at present.  Click the
                    "Change" button for default cell type, and pick a
                    type.  If you want a grassy area, choose grass.  If you
                    want a desert area, choose sand, and so on.
                </ol>
                <div class="alert alert-warning"
                     role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    Below you will see how to extend this list of cell
                    types with new ones, but for now, choose something
                    already in the database.</div>

                     role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                    Be sure to choose a cell type that isn't a wall, or
                    water, or something impossible to walk on!  You're
                    about to fill your whole plane with this cell type.
                    If you make it something you can't stand on, the
                    game will immediately teleport you out of the plane,
                    until you fix the mistake and teleport back.</div>
                <p>That's it!  You've created a plane!</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it's all the same repeated pattern
                everywhere.  If you want to make it more interesting, by
                shaping the land around you with many different cell types
                and other decorations, move on to the "Changing the world"

                <p>If you click the Cell Types table button in the Database

                    You will need to upload an image to use as your cell's

                    sure not to take an image unless you have it's author's
                    permission to do so.)  When you have an image file you
                    want to use as the icon, proceed to the next step.</li>
                <li>Click the Change button next to the icon.  Click the
                    Browse button and find on your computer the image file
                    you want to use.  Click Start upload, then click OK, and
                    you should see your uploaded icon.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Warning!</b>
                    Using very large image files will slow down the
                    game by creating too much network traffic and too
                    much drawing time in the user's browser.  Note the
                    suggested size given to you by the game on the image
                    upload screen, and if your image is too big, first
                    resize it on your computer before uploading it into
                    the game.</div>
                <ol class="split">
                <li>Use the various Change buttons to specify the cell
                    type's name and optionally its border size and color.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Tip:</b>
                    Borders are absent by default (size zero) but if you
                    use them, they can help make one particular cell
                    type stand out from its surroundings.  Adjacent
                    cell types that both have borders aren't a good
                    idea.  You will not see the border until you put
                    some cells onto the game map, as taught below.</div>
                <ol class="split">
                <li>If you want the cell type to be walkable, leave the
                    "Who can walk on this?" field set to "all."  If you want
                    the cell type to be non-walkable (like a wall, or an
                    ocean) then Change that field and set it to "none."</li>
                </ol>
